EEB1320_Ecology

This is the GitHub repository for the Lab works of EEB1320 from 2014. 

The folders will be organized in the following way: 

First, each lab will have its on folder, named with the lab number, followed by an underline, and the word Lab.
Whithin each of this folders, we are going to have the following following folders:

- R/ : Which will contain the R functions commonly used in the analysis
- data: Which will contain the data for the lab
- inst/examples/ : Which will contain saved Knitr files, as Rmd, with descriptions of what we are doing in each block, figures, codes, supporting texts, etc. Whenever long blocks of code functions became "stable", they will be moved to the R/ directory, when they will receive formal documentation and can be more easily used in later examples. 
- inst/doc/ : Which will contain mature documents, ready to be submitted.
- DESCRIPTION: Which will be a *.md file, with the metadata of each lab. 

This organization will start more properly in the 03_Lab.
